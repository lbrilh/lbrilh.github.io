I'm a 24-year-old master's student specializing in Statistics and Quantitative Finance at ETH Zurich, where I previously earned a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics in 2022. During my bachelor's, I focused on theoretical computer science and cryptography.

From October 2023 to April 2024, I wrote my master's thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Peter Bühlmann](https://stat.ethz.ch/~buhlmann/) at the Seminar for Statistics/ETH AI Center, with co-supervision by [Malte Londschien](https://www.londschien.ch/), a Doctoral Fellow at ETH AI Center. In my thesis, I investigated the performance of intensive care prediction models across health care institutions using 300’000 intensive care admissions from the US and Switzerland.

I am currently doing an internship as a Statistician / Economist in the economic forecasting section at the Central Bank of Germany / European Central Bank.
