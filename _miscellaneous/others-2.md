I deployed my own tokens on a DEX based on Uniswap on Ethereum and created liquidity pairs for trading. Additionally, I wrote a smart contract that is able to view the pool balances of tokens in the DEX and that is able to perform atomic triple swaps of tokens A, B and C where one should receive at most value C of token C.
