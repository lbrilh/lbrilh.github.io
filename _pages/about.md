I'm a master student in Mathematics at ETH Zürich where I specialize in Data Science and Machine Learning. I received a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics at ETH Zurich in 2022. During my Bachelor's I focused on theoretical computer science and cryptography. Currently, I am writing my master thesis and I am supervised by [Prof. Peter Bühlmann](https://stat.ethz.ch/~buhlmann/) (Seminar for Statistics/ETH AI Center) and co-supervised by [Malte Londschien](https://www.londschien.ch/) (Doctoral Fellow at ETH AI Center).
