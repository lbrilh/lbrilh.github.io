I'm a 24-year-old master's student specializing in Statistics and Quantitative Finance at ETH Zurich, where I previously earned a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics in 2022. During my bachelor's, I focused on theoretical computer science and cryptography.

From October 2023 to April 2024, I wrote my master's thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Peter BÃ¼hlmann](https://stat.ethz.ch/~buhlmann/) at the Seminar for Statistics/ETH AI Center, with co-supervision by [Malte Londschien](https://www.londschien.ch/), a Doctoral Fellow at ETH AI Center. I wrote my thesis on predictor robustness and distributional robustness of (non-)linear and tree-based models in intensive care.

I am doing an internship as a Credit Risk Quant at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. Before joining Deutsche, I worked as a Statistician in the seasonal adjustment division at the Central Bank of Germany / European Central Bank minimizing model risk for macroeconomic indicators.
