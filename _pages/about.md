I'm a 24-year-old master's student specializing in Statistics and Quantitative Finance at ETH Zurich, where I previously earned a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics in 2022. During my bachelor's, I focused on theoretical computer science and cryptography.

In October 2023, I started my master's thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Peter BÃ¼hlmann](https://stat.ethz.ch/~buhlmann/) at the Seminar for Statistics/ETH AI Center, with co-supervision by [Malte Londschien](https://www.londschien.ch/), a Doctoral Fellow at ETH AI Center.
